### Idea Of Project 
--------------------
<p>
Basic idea of the project is to show ray diagrams of refraction through glass slab and prism and give the emergence angle.
We used snell's law to calculate angles and coordinates of rays passing.

In glass slab we traced out the ray diagram and calculate the angle of emergence by taking refractive index as user input.

In prism we traced out ray diagram and calculated angle of emergence and angle of deviation by taking refractive index,incident angle and refractive angle as user input.
